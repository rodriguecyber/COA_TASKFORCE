          - If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
          - If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
          -  If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the
          order specified above.
          - if is not devided by 3 or 5 return `string not diveded by either 3 or 5`
